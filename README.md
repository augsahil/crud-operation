# MongoDB CRUD using Python

This is a sample project showing how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB from a Python application, in a modular, clean structure.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB server running (e.g. locally on default port 27017)
- `pymongo` package

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # (on Linux / macOS)
   venv\Scripts\activate       # (on Windows)
   ```
